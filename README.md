# Simple Linear Regression on Marketing Campaigns

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the use of **simple linear regression** to analyze and model the relationship between marketing campaign expenditures and sales revenue. Specifically, the focus is on understanding how radio promotion budget influences sales.

The analysis uses a dataset containing marketing campaign budgets across TV, radio, and social media, along with corresponding sales figures. The goal is to help company leaders make informed decisions on where to allocate future marketing resources by uncovering patterns in the data.

## Project Overview

* Explore the dataset containing marketing campaign budgets and sales.
* Use statistical modeling (simple linear regression) to quantify the relationship between radio budget and sales.
* Visualize the data and regression results for clear communication of findings.
* Provide actionable insights for business strategy based on the analysis.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

* Python 3.x
* pandas: for data manipulation
* matplotlib and seaborn: for data visualization
* statsmodels: for statistical modeling and regression analysis

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed with the required libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`).
3. Run the notebook (`.ipynb` file) in Jupyter Notebook or compatible environment.
4. Follow the step-by-step cells to see data loading, exploration, regression modeling, and visualization.

## File Contents

* **Notebook.ipynb**: Contains the full analysis workflow, including data import, exploratory analysis, model fitting, and visualization.

## Key Concepts

* Simple Linear Regression: Modeling a linear relationship between one independent variable (radio budget) and one dependent variable (sales).
* Interpretation of regression coefficients.
* Visualizing regression line and residuals.
* Using statistical metrics to assess model fit.
